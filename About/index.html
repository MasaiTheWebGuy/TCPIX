                <h3>Call Tyrone..</h3>
                <p>Hey there! My name is Tyrone and I am a Web Developer and Photographer based out of
                    Charlotte, NC. I am extremely passionate about helping people achieve their goals. Be it that
                    they are looking to get their next start-up business off the ground or 
                    aid in launching the next big artist through their preferred platform. <br>
                    When I am not Photo-Gramming, I am building self-helping apps to aid my everyday woos or playing some of my favorite fighting video games online.
                    <br> <br>
                    I would love to work with you on a future project. Whether you are looking for a new <a href="#">website</a> for your brand, <a href="#">pictures</a> for your next event and moments or <a href="#">both</a>, you can <a href="#">contact me here</a> and we can get started!
                    <br> <br>
                    I look forward to working with you. Thank you for stopping by
                </p>
